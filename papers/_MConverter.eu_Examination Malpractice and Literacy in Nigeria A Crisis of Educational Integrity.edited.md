# Examination Malpractice and Literacy in Nigeria: A Crisis of Educational Integrity

## Section 1: Introduction and Literature Review

### Introduction

Education is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of human and national
development, equipping individuals with the knowledge and competencies
necessary for societal progress. In Nigeria, education occupies a
particularly significant role as both an aspiration and a promise of
mobility in a nation characterised by complex socio-economic challenges.
Central to the educational process is the evaluation of learning
outcomes through examinations, which are meant to serve as impartial
measures of students\' comprehension, literacy, and readiness for higher
education or employment. Yet, in practice, Nigeria\'s examination
culture has been plagued by systemic malpractice that has undermined the
validity of results and the broader goals of education.

Among the most critical national examinations are the West African
Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), conducted by the West
African Examinations Council (WAEC), and the Senior School Certificate
Examination (SSCE), conducted by the National Examinations Council
(NECO). These examinations are theoretically intended to certify the
completion of secondary school and to measure the literacy, numeracy,
and analytical capacity of students. However, both have become
synonymous with malpractice, ranging from the leaking of exam papers to
the widespread purchase of \"expo\"---slang for leaked answers shared
through networks of teachers, supervisors, and increasingly, online
platforms.

The consequences of this pervasive malpractice are dire. While
statistics from WAEC and NECO often report improved pass rates, these
figures mask the reality of a declining standard of literacy and
competence among school leavers. In many Nigerian universities,
lecturers lament that undergraduates who obtained high grades in WASSCE
and NECO cannot construct coherent essays or comprehend academic texts
(Ajiboye & Oyewole, 2021). The paradox is that the nation continues to
boast relatively high examination success rates, while employers and
educators simultaneously bemoan the poor quality of graduates. This
contradiction underscores the urgency of examining how cheating distorts
literacy and erodes the integrity of Nigeria\'s education system.

This paper explores the prevalence of cheating among Nigerian students,
focusing on its effects on actual literacy levels as compared to
recorded figures. It considers the systemic corruption that enables
malpractice, including the complicity of schools and supervisors, the
commercialisation of leaked exam papers, and the growing role of
websites, WhatsApp, and Telegram groups in distributing
answers---sometimes even for free. In doing so, the paper situates the
issue not only as an educational concern but as a broader societal
challenge that threatens Nigeria\'s economic competitiveness and social
cohesion.

### The Context of Examination Malpractice in Nigeria

Examination malpractice is not a new phenomenon in Nigeria; its history
stretches back to at least the 1970s, when the growing demand for
education outpaced the resources and governance structures needed to
maintain integrity (Onuka & Arowojolu, 2020). Over the decades,
malpractice has evolved from isolated cases of cheating by desperate
students to a systemic industry involving teachers, school
administrators, supervisors, technology operators, and online networks.

A landmark study by Olatunji (2019) categorises examination malpractice
in Nigeria into three levels:

1.  **Individual malpractice**, such as students smuggling notes into
    exam halls or whispering answers.

2.  **Institutional malpractice** occurs when schools, supervisors, and
    teachers actively collude to inflate success rates.

3.  **Commercial malpractice** involves the organised sale of leaked
    exam questions and answers through dedicated websites, subscription
    platforms, and social media groups.

This typology reflects the deep entrenchment of malpractice, revealing
that the problem is no longer confined to individual misbehaviour but
has become embedded within Nigeria\'s educational and technological
landscape.

Government bodies and examination councils have often responded with
bans, sanctions, and public awareness campaigns. For instance, WAEC
blacklisted over 100 supervisors in 2022 for their involvement in
malpractice (WAEC, 2022). NECO, too, has repeatedly warned against the
proliferation of \"special centres,\" schools notorious for guaranteeing
cheating in exchange for higher fees (NECO, 2021). Despite these
interventions, the malpractice industry continues to thrive, suggesting
that enforcement mechanisms remain inadequate against the sophistication
and scale of the problem.

### Theoretical Framework: Educational Integrity and Literacy

This study is anchored in the theoretical framework of educational
integrity, which emphasises fairness, accountability, and the alignment
of assessment with actual learning outcomes (Bretag, 2019). Integrity in
assessment ensures that grades and certifications reflect genuine
knowledge rather than fraudulent practices. When compromised, the entire
educational system risks becoming performative, producing what Illich
(1971) once described as \"schooled society,\" where credentials
substitute for competence.

Applied to Nigeria, the integrity framework helps to explain why
reported literacy levels do not match the lived reality. According to
UNESCO, Nigeria has made progress in reducing illiteracy, with adult
literacy rising to approximately 62% by 2020 (UNESCO, 2021). Yet,
numerous studies demonstrate that students emerging from the school
system often lack functional literacy---defined as the ability to read,
write, and apply knowledge to everyday contexts (Olaoye, 2022). The
disjuncture between reported literacy rates and functional literacy
reflects the corrosive effect of malpractice: students may \"pass\"
English or literature exams on paper without actually developing the
underlying skills.

### Literature Review

#### Examination Malpractice in West Africa

Nigeria is not alone in grappling with examination malpractice; across
West Africa, the integrity of national examinations has been
persistently challenged. Research by Adeyemo and Fapohunda (2021) shows
that in Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, WAEC exams have similarly been
compromised by leaks and organised cheating. However, Nigeria\'s scale,
population, and pervasive digital culture make the phenomenon
particularly acute. With over 1.6 million candidates sitting for WASSCE
annually, even small percentages of malpractice translate into vast
numbers of compromised results (WAEC, 2023).

#### Literacy and the \"Certificate Culture\"

Several Nigerian scholars have linked the culture of cheating to the
broader societal emphasis on certificates rather than competence
(Okebukola, 2023; Obioma, 2020). In what is often described as a
\"certificate society,\" success is measured by the acquisition of
formal qualifications rather than demonstrated skills. As a result, both
students and institutions prioritise passing examinations---by any
means---over actual learning. This dynamic explains why schools often
collude in malpractice: high pass rates enhance their reputations and
attract new enrolments, even if those results are fraudulent.

Ajiboye and Oyewole (2021) note that the obsession with certificates has
produced a paradox where universities admit students with strong paper
qualifications who nevertheless lack basic literacy. In their study of
three Nigerian universities, the authors found that over 40% of
first-year students could not summarise a simple academic passage or
write grammatically correct sentences. This finding highlights the chasm
between recorded literacy rates and functional literacy levels.

#### The Role of Technology and Social Media

One of the most significant transformations in malpractice has been the
role of digital technologies. Earlier forms of cheating relied on
physical collusion within exam halls, but contemporary malpractice is
heavily mediated by technology. Premium Times (2024) reported that
entire websites are dedicated to selling WAEC and NECO papers for as
little as ₦500, while Telegram and WhatsApp groups distribute both free
and paid versions of leaked questions. The 2025 WASSCE English paper
leak demonstrated this vividly, with questions and answers circulating
at 2 a.m. on the day of the examination (Premium Times, 2025).

The proliferation of online malpractice reflects both technological
opportunism and a cultural shift in how students perceive examinations.
Many candidates treat the purchase of \"expo\" as a normal part of exam
preparation, comparable to buying textbooks or revision guides. Some
even expect answers to be shared for free, reinforcing their perception
that the examinations themselves are meaningless (Guardian Nigeria,
2025).

#### Institutional Complicity and Supervisors

The literature also highlights the role of institutional actors in
perpetuating malpractice. NECO (2021) has repeatedly warned that
\"special centres\" are effectively businesses designed to guarantee
high pass rates through organised cheating. These centres thrive with
the cooperation of school administrators, supervisors, and sometimes
even local education officials.

WAEC\'s decision to blacklist over 100 supervisors in 2022 (WAEC, 2022)
underscores how deep this complicity runs. Yet, such punitive measures
are often insufficient. Olatunji (2019) argues that sanctions are
undermined by the fact that demand for malpractice remains high; as long
as parents and students seek guaranteed results, there will always be
supply chains of willing supervisors and schools.

#### Consequences for Higher Education and the Workforce

Perhaps the most pressing concern in the literature is the long-term
consequences of cheating for higher education and national development.
Obioma (2020) and Onwuka (2023) both highlight the frustration of
employers and universities with graduates who lack basic communication
and critical thinking skills. Employers in Nigeria increasingly lament
that graduates cannot draft reports, engage in problem-solving, or
communicate professionally in English (Onwuka, 2023). This decline is
directly traceable to a pipeline that certifies students without
educating them.

Some scholars describe this as the production of \"half-baked
graduates\" (Okebukola, 2023). Others, in more blunt terms, suggest that
Nigeria\'s current trajectory risks producing \"stupid undergraduates
and graduates\" who lack the intellectual depth required for a
competitive economy. While such language may be controversial, it
captures the frustration of stakeholders confronting an education system
that produces certificates without skills.

### Summary of Literature

The literature demonstrates that examination malpractice in Nigeria is
not an isolated phenomenon but a systemic issue rooted in societal
values, institutional complicity, and technological facilitation. While
WAEC and NECO continue to present success rates as indicators of
progress, these figures mask the decline of functional literacy and the
growing irrelevance of secondary school examinations in the eyes of
students. The literature also establishes that the consequences of
malpractice extend beyond education, undermining the quality of
Nigeria\'s workforce and threatening the nation\'s long-term
development.

This study builds upon these insights by providing a detailed analysis
of malpractice in Nigeria, focusing specifically on its impact on
literacy levels, the comparative credibility of WASSCE/NECO versus JAMB
UTME, and the role of websites and social media platforms in sustaining
a malpractice economy. It also examines the institutional complicity of
schools and supervisors, before presenting a case study of the 2025
WASSCE English paper leak and its implications.

## Section 2: The Impact of Cheating on Literacy

### Understanding Literacy in the Nigerian Context

Literacy is often understood in narrow terms: the ability to read and
write. However, scholars now emphasise *functional literacy*---the
capacity to use reading, writing, and critical thinking to engage
effectively in academic, professional, and everyday life contexts
(UNESCO, 2018). For a society as complex as Nigeria\'s, functional
literacy is critical for democratic participation, employability, and
innovation.

In Nigeria, reported literacy rates have steadily improved over the past
two decades. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS, 2022),
youth literacy (ages 15--24) stands at about 75%, while adult literacy
is around 62%. Yet these figures are increasingly contested because they
rely heavily on self-reporting and examination outcomes. When the very
examinations designed to measure learning outcomes are undermined by
cheating, reported literacy figures cannot be taken at face value. This
creates a paradox: Nigeria records progress in literacy while
simultaneously producing undergraduates and graduates who lack basic
comprehension and communication skills.

The pervasive culture of examination malpractice therefore strikes at
the very heart of literacy, because it severs the connection between
certification and competence. In this sense, the issue is not only
educational but epistemological: Nigeria risks institutionalising a
false representation of what it means to be literate.

### Distorted Literacy Within the School Environment

Cheating within the school environment has direct effects on how
students approach reading, writing, and comprehension. When students
rely on leaked answers or supervisors\' assistance, the incentive to
study diminishes significantly. Over time, this leads to a culture where
memorisation and shortcuts replace genuine learning.

#### Loss of Motivation to Read and Write

Students who expect \"expo\" no longer see the need to engage with
textbooks, literature, or academic materials. Studies show that many
Nigerian students do not purchase or read prescribed texts in English
literature, expecting that questions and answers will be circulated
before the exam (Adebisi, 2020). This avoidance of sustained reading
undermines both comprehension and vocabulary development---two key
pillars of literacy.

The result is visible in essay writing. Ajiboye and Oyewole (2021) found
that secondary school graduates admitted to Nigerian universities often
struggle to compose grammatically correct sentences or to organise ideas
coherently in essays. This reflects the cumulative impact of avoiding
actual literacy-building tasks throughout secondary education.

#### The \"Special Centre\" Syndrome

The institutionalisation of \"special centres\"---schools known for
organised cheating---exacerbates the problem. Candidates attending these
centres often pay high fees in exchange for guaranteed malpractice. As a
result, the centre, rather than the classroom, becomes the locus of
learning. Literacy is no longer developed through structured reading and
writing exercises but through memorising answers distributed hours
before the exam.

Okebukola (2023) notes that this system creates a situation where
schools function as \"certificate factories,\" producing pass rates
rather than literate students. The broader consequence is that
functional literacy is systematically displaced by a culture of
dependence on malpractice.

#### Teacher Complicity and Pedagogical Decline

Another consequence is the erosion of teaching quality. Teachers who are
complicit in malpractice often reduce their classroom efforts, assuming
that students will secure \"expo\" anyway. This further diminishes
opportunities for literacy development. A study in Ogun State revealed
that some teachers openly advise students to save money for malpractice
rather than spending time studying, because \"everybody cheats in WAEC\"
(Oladipo, 2021). Such attitudes compromise pedagogy and further
normalise illiteracy.

### Literacy Outside the School Environment

The impact of cheating is not confined to the classroom; it also
manifests in how students interact with society after leaving school.

#### University Admissions and Literacy Shock

Students who pass WASSCE and NECO through malpractice often encounter a
\"literacy shock\" upon entering universities, where continuous
assessment, independent reading, and essay writing are required. Obioma
(2020) reports that many first-year undergraduates in Nigeria\'s
universities fail remedial English tests, despite obtaining credit
passes in WASSCE. This mismatch reflects the disjunction between
certification and competence.

#### Employment and Workplace Communication

Employers frequently complain that graduates cannot write basic memos,
draft reports, or communicate professionally (Onwuka, 2023). This is
particularly damaging in fields where literacy is essential, such as
law, journalism, public administration, and teaching. When graduates
lack literacy, workplace productivity suffers. Moreover, the inability
to write clearly contributes to errors, inefficiency, and reputational
harm for organisations.

#### Civic and Social Participation

Functional literacy is also essential for citizenship. Citizens need to
read newspapers, understand government documents, and participate in
democratic processes. A generation of students who pass exams without
learning may hold certificates but lack the ability to critically
interpret political manifestos, health information, or financial
contracts. This weakens democratic participation and perpetuates social
vulnerability.

### Psychological Effects: The Normalisation of Dishonesty

Beyond technical skills, cheating corrodes the values associated with
literacy---honesty, effort, and critical inquiry. Students who
repeatedly succeed through malpractice internalise dishonesty as a
legitimate strategy. This has broader social implications, as graduates
carry these values into workplaces and public institutions.

Ige (2021) argues that Nigeria\'s corruption problem is reinforced by
examination malpractice. When young people learn that cheating is a
normal path to success, they are more likely to engage in corrupt
practices later in life. Thus, the literacy deficit is not only
cognitive but moral.

### Case Examples and Empirical Data

#### Declining Writing Skills in Universities

In a survey of lecturers at the University of Lagos, 68% reported that
undergraduates admitted through WASSCE and NECO results could not
summarise an academic article without plagiarising large sections
(Ajiboye & Oyewole, 2021). This indicates not just poor literacy but
also a lack of academic integrity, a habit likely formed in secondary
school.

#### Supervisor Complicity

WAEC\'s decision to blacklist more than 100 supervisors in 2022 for
collusion in malpractice (WAEC, 2022) is revealing. Supervisors, who
should safeguard exam integrity, often enable malpractice by allowing
candidates to use phones, distributing leaked questions, or ignoring
collusion. Their complicity undermines the examination environment,
making literacy irrelevant as a criterion for success.

#### Schools Boosting Reputation

Schools themselves are often motivated by the desire to boost their
reputations. In Kwara State, for example, several private schools were
sanctioned in 2023 for inflating results and facilitating malpractice in
order to attract more students and higher fees (NECO, 2023). This
demonstrates that malpractice is not merely tolerated but actively used
as a marketing tool. The consequence is the systemic erosion of literacy
development, as institutions themselves subvert the very goals they are
meant to serve.

### Technology, Free Papers, and the Devaluation of Literacy

The increasing availability of leaked papers online further undermines
literacy by reducing examinations to an exercise in logistics. Premium
Times (2024) documented websites openly selling WAEC and NECO papers for
as little as ₦500. Meanwhile, Guardian Nigeria (2025) reported that some
Telegram groups distribute leaked papers for free.

The fact that papers are sometimes shared freely indicates that many
students and facilitators see the examinations as meaningless. In this
view, literacy and competence are irrelevant; what matters is obtaining
the certificate. This perception creates a feedback loop: as more
students cheat, the exams lose credibility, and as the exams lose
credibility, more students feel justified in cheating.

### Long-Term Societal Impact on Literacy

The cumulative impact of cheating is a society where literacy is
simulated rather than real. Nigeria risks becoming a nation of
paper-literate citizens---those who hold certificates but lack
functional skills. This has several implications:

1.  **Educational Implications**: Universities are forced to lower their
    standards to accommodate underprepared students, leading to overall
    academic decline (Obioma, 2020).

2.  **Economic Implications**: Employers face skill gaps, forcing them
    to spend resources on retraining or outsourcing work.

3.  **Social Implications**: Citizens lack the critical literacy needed
    for democracy, making them vulnerable to manipulation and
    disinformation.

4.  **Cultural Implications**: A culture of cheating undermines the
    intrinsic value of education, replacing it with a transactional view
    of learning as a means to certificates.

### Summary of Section 2

Cheating profoundly distorts literacy both within and outside Nigeria\'s
school system. By substituting genuine reading and writing with
shortcuts, malpractice erodes functional literacy and normalises
dishonesty. Within schools, students avoid reading and rely on \"expo,\"
while teachers reduce pedagogical effort. Outside schools,
undergraduates encounter literacy shocks, employers face incompetent
graduates, and citizens lack critical literacy for societal engagement.
Technology has accelerated the problem, with websites and social media
groups devaluing examinations by selling or freely sharing leaked
papers.

Ultimately, the impact of cheating on literacy cannot be overstated: it
produces undergraduates, graduates, and workforce members who are
ill-equipped for intellectual, professional, or civic life.

## Section 3: The Perceived Uselessness of WASSCE and NECO SSCE

### Introduction

In Nigeria\'s educational system, the West African Senior School
Certificate Examination (WASSCE) conducted by the West African
Examinations Council (WAEC) and the Senior School Certificate
Examination (SSCE) conducted by the National Examinations Council (NECO)
have traditionally been regarded as the definitive indicators of
academic readiness for higher education. For decades, these examinations
served as the ultimate gateway to university admission and a benchmark
for academic credibility. However, in recent years, a growing perception
has emerged that these certificates are increasingly \"useless.\" This
sentiment is voiced by students, teachers, parents, and employers alike,
and is grounded in a number of interrelated realities: widespread
cheating, the dominance of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board
(JAMB) Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) in admissions,
and the declining functional value of the certificates in both
educational and professional contexts.

### The Rise of JAMB UTME and the Marginalisation of WASSCE/NECO

One of the central factors fuelling the perception of uselessness is the
structural role of JAMB. Since the 1970s, the JAMB UTME has been the
primary determinant of university admission in Nigeria. In practice,
this means that even students who excel in WASSCE or NECO must also pass
UTME to gain admission. For many students, therefore, WASSCE and NECO
results have become secondary hurdles rather than the ultimate
determinants of academic progression (Owolabi, 2020).

This has led to a reconfiguration of educational priorities. Students
often devote more attention to preparing for UTME than to their senior
secondary school examinations. This shift not only undermines the
perceived value of WASSCE and NECO but also exacerbates malpractice in
them, as students increasingly view these exams as formalities that must
simply be passed, by any means, in order to move on to UTME. In this
sense, WASSCE and NECO become \"tickets\" rather than measures of
literacy and competence.

### The Culture of Malpractice and the Devaluation of Certificates

The widespread availability of leaked questions and organised
malpractice has accelerated the decline in the perceived value of WASSCE
and NECO. As discussed in the previous section, entire websites,
WhatsApp groups, and Telegram channels now traffic in examination
\"dubs\"---slang for leaked questions and answers. Many of these
platforms openly advertise their services, charging between ₦500 and
₦2,000 for access, while others distribute them for free. The fact that
examination papers are sometimes shared at no cost underscores the
extent to which students and facilitators regard these exams as
meaningless (Premium Times, 2024; Guardian Nigeria, 2025).

For students, this culture reinforces the idea that genuine preparation
is unnecessary. Passing WASSCE or NECO becomes less a matter of study
and more a matter of securing access to the right network or group.
Schools, too, often abet this system in order to boost their reputations
and attract prospective parents. By advertising high pass rates,
sometimes inflated or obtained through collusion, schools use
examination results as marketing tools rather than educational
achievements (NECO, 2023).

This dynamic creates a vicious cycle: as more students cheat, the
credibility of the exams diminishes, and as credibility diminishes,
students feel justified in cheating, since the exams appear already
devalued.

### Employers and Universities\' Disregard for WASSCE/NECO

Employers and universities have adapted to this erosion of credibility
by deprioritising WASSCE and NECO results. University admission
processes rely heavily on JAMB scores, often considering SSCE results
only for minimum requirements (credits in English, Mathematics, and a
few core subjects). Employers, for their part, frequently view SSCE
certificates as insufficient indicators of competence. Anecdotal
evidence from recruiters in Lagos and Abuja suggests that many firms no
longer assess SSCE results during hiring but instead rely on university
degrees, professional certificates, or aptitude tests (Onwuka, 2023).

This erosion of trust in SSCE certificates reflects broader doubts about
the reliability of the literacy they supposedly measure. When employers
and higher institutions no longer treat WASSCE and NECO as credible
assessments, the certificates inevitably lose value in the eyes of
students themselves.

### The Student Perspective: Why Study When Exams Are Useless?

For many Nigerian students, the perception of uselessness is pragmatic.
They argue that since universities prioritise UTME, and since employers
rarely ask for WASSCE or NECO results, investing effort in genuine
preparation is unnecessary. Instead, resources are better directed
toward securing UTME success or simply obtaining SSCE passes by any
means available, including malpractice.

Focus group discussions conducted in Enugu and Ibadan by Adebisi (2020)
revealed that a majority of senior secondary school students admitted to
having little interest in preparing for literature, history, or civic
education subjects, since these are \"not needed for JAMB.\" Instead,
they relied on \"expo\" for those subjects, while focusing their efforts
narrowly on the subjects most relevant to their chosen university
courses. This instrumental view of education narrows students\'
intellectual development and reinforces the marginalisation of
broad-based literacy.

### WAEC/NECO as \"Rites of Passage\" Rather than Academic Assessment

Another significant factor is the cultural transformation of WASSCE and
NECO into rites of passage. For many families, the completion of
secondary education and participation in these exams is celebrated
regardless of actual performance. Passing them, even through
malpractice, is seen as symbolic of maturity and social advancement.
This cultural framing reduces the emphasis on genuine literacy,
replacing it with an emphasis on certificates as markers of transition
into adulthood.

In this sense, WASSCE and NECO retain social significance but lose
educational significance. They function less as tests of knowledge and
more as rituals of certification, validating students\' passage through
the system without necessarily ensuring competence.

### The Creation of \"Stupid Undergraduates\" and a Weak Workforce

Perhaps the most damaging outcome of this devaluation is the production
of undergraduates and graduates who lack basic literacy skills.
Universities admit students who have cleared WASSCE and NECO but cannot
write coherent essays, interpret texts, or engage in critical analysis.
Lecturers frequently lament that they must spend significant time
teaching remedial writing and comprehension to students who already hold
SSCE credit passes (Ajiboye & Oyewole, 2021).

The consequence is that Nigeria\'s workforce is increasingly populated
by certificate holders without corresponding competence. Employers face
graduates who cannot draft professional correspondence, conduct basic
research, or communicate effectively in written English. This disconnect
contributes to inefficiency, low productivity, and reputational risks
for organisations.

Moreover, the societal acceptance of malpractice fosters an ethos of
dishonesty that spills into workplaces and governance. Just as students
cheat to pass exams, graduates may manipulate accounts, falsify reports,
or engage in corrupt practices. In this way, the perceived uselessness
of WASSCE and NECO is not merely an academic issue but a national
development challenge.

### Attempts at Reform and Their Limitations

WAEC and NECO have repeatedly announced measures to curb malpractice,
including the blacklisting of supervisors, the use of biometric
registration, and the deployment of technology to monitor examinations.
In 2022, WAEC blacklisted over 100 supervisors for collusion in
malpractice (WAEC, 2022). However, these measures have not significantly
shifted public perception. Students and parents often dismiss them as
cosmetic, pointing to the continued availability of leaked papers
online.

Furthermore, the reliance on supervisors---many of whom are themselves
complicit---undermines enforcement. Reports abound of supervisors who
collect bribes to permit malpractice or who directly provide answers to
candidates (Oladipo, 2021). In such contexts, reforms appear
superficial, reinforcing rather than dispelling the perception that
WASSCE and NECO are unreliable.

### Comparative Perspective: International Examinations

The perception of uselessness is further reinforced by comparison with
international examinations such as the International General Certificate
of Secondary Education (IGCSE), SAT, and TOEFL. Nigerian elites
increasingly prefer to enrol their children in schools that prepare for
these international exams, which are regarded as more credible and
globally recognised (Owolabi, 2020).

The growing market for international examinations highlights the
declining status of WASSCE and NECO. Middle-class and wealthy families
are voting with their wallets, opting out of a system they perceive as
compromised. This trend further entrenches inequality, as only affluent
families can afford these alternatives, while poorer families remain
trapped in a system that no longer commands respect.

### Summary of Section 3

The perception of WASSCE and NECO as \"useless\" emerges from multiple
overlapping realities: the dominance of JAMB UTME in university
admissions, the culture of malpractice that devalues certificates, the
disregard of employers and universities, and the student conviction that
effort is wasted on exams that no longer measure competence. Schools
contribute to the problem by facilitating malpractice to boost
reputations, while supervisors and websites openly undermine exam
credibility. The result is a cycle in which WASSCE and NECO function
more as rites of passage than as measures of literacy, producing
undergraduates and graduates who are ill-prepared for higher education,
employment, and civic life.

Ultimately, the uselessness of these exams is not merely a perception
but a lived reality, manifested in the incompetence of students and the
distrust of employers and universities. Without systemic reforms that
restore credibility and reconnect certification to competence, WASSCE
and NECO will continue to produce certificates without literacy,
graduates without skills, and a workforce unprepared for national
development.

## Section 4: Prevalent Strategies for Cheating

### Introduction

Cheating in Nigerian examinations is not merely a sporadic occurrence
but has evolved into an entrenched subculture with complex networks,
commercial structures, and institutional complicity. Strategies for
academic dishonesty extend beyond isolated incidents of copying or
whispering in exam halls; they involve sophisticated systems of leaks,
digital platforms, complicit schools, and even corrupted supervisors.
These strategies illustrate both the ingenuity and desperation of
stakeholders---students, parents, schools, and criminal syndicates---who
perceive examinations as hurdles to be circumvented rather than
assessments of competence.

### Purchasing Exam Papers Online

One of the most visible strategies in recent years has been the
commodification of leaked exam papers online. Entire websites openly
advertise access to WASSCE and NECO \"dubs,\" often promising verified
questions and answers delivered before or during exam sessions.
Investigative reports show that access can be purchased for as little as
₦500, with premium packages offering full subject bundles at higher
prices (Premium Times, 2024).

These sites are brazen in their operations. Some use
professional-looking interfaces, complete with payment gateways, while
others rely on more informal channels like bank transfers and mobile
money. They often market themselves as \"help centres\" or \"expo
platforms,\" framing their services as student support rather than
outright malpractice. The normalisation of such commercialised cheating
underscores how deeply exam dishonesty has been integrated into the
educational landscape.

### WhatsApp and Telegram Groups

The rise of social media platforms has provided fertile ground for exam
malpractice. WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and even Facebook
communities are widely used to distribute exam papers and solutions.
Typically, students or parents pay a fee to join exclusive groups, where
questions are posted shortly before or even during the exam. In some
cases, the administrators of these groups leak answers directly into
students\' devices while they are seated in examination halls (The
Nation, 2023).

Equally alarming is the growing trend of free distribution. Some groups,
in an attempt to build notoriety or attract large followings, release
questions and answers without charge. This practice reinforces the
perception that examinations like WASSCE and NECO are already devalued,
since answers are shared so widely and cheaply. Students consequently
approach exams not as academic challenges but as predictable
transactions in a system where knowledge is irrelevant.

### Supervisor Collusion and School Complicity

While online platforms are prominent, offline strategies remain central
to malpractice. WAEC and NECO supervisors---officials tasked with
ensuring fairness in examinations---are frequently implicated in aiding
malpractice. In 2022, WAEC announced the blacklisting of over 100
supervisors for collusion in exam fraud, including instances where
supervisors collected bribes or provided answers directly to candidates
(WAEC, 2022).

Schools, too, are complicit. Many institutions deliberately facilitate
malpractice to boost their reputations. By ensuring high pass rates,
schools market themselves as centres of academic excellence and attract
prospective students. This often involves arranging for \"special
centres\" where invigilators overlook malpractice or where answer sheets
are written collectively by teachers and distributed to students. In
such contexts, exam malpractice is less a student strategy than an
institutionalised practice designed to serve the interests of schools as
much as candidates (Onwuka, 2023).

### Impersonation and Hiring of Mercenaries

Another common method is impersonation, where individuals are paid to
sit exams on behalf of registered candidates. Such impersonators---often
university undergraduates or graduates---use falsified identification or
exploit lax verification systems to write exams. This practice is
facilitated by weak biometric controls and by the corruption of
officials willing to look the other way for financial gain (Adebayo,
2021).

Mercenary writing not only compromises the integrity of results but also
reinforces the social acceptability of dishonesty. Parents who hire
impersonators for their children signal to them that deceit is
permissible, while candidates who participate learn to rely on
fraudulent shortcuts.

### Technological Devices and Innovations

Advancements in technology have introduced new strategies for cheating.
Students now use micro-earpieces, smartwatches, calculators preloaded
with information, and even hidden cameras connected to collaborators
outside exam halls. Some have been caught with miniature Bluetooth
devices sewn into clothing or concealed in their hair. These strategies
require financial investment, underscoring the extent to which exam
cheating has become an industry in itself (Vanguard, 2022).

### The Economics of Exam Malpractice

The business of cheating has become lucrative, sustaining networks of
actors who profit from the desperation of students. Site operators,
group administrators, complicit teachers, and even printers of fake
papers benefit from this ecosystem. By keeping prices low---sometimes as
low as ₦500 for access---operators ensure that malpractice is accessible
to virtually all socioeconomic classes. Meanwhile, premium packages
targeting wealthier families guarantee personalised services, including
private channels and one-on-one \"runs\" with candidates.

This commercialisation creates an economy in which malpractice is not an
anomaly but a service industry. Its accessibility undermines efforts by
WAEC, NECO, and government regulators to curb malpractice, since demand
remains consistently high and supply is diversified across platforms.

### Free Distribution as a Sign of Devaluation

Perhaps the most revealing dimension is the trend toward free sharing of
exam questions. In some cases, platforms release questions to
demonstrate their credibility, using free leaks as advertisements for
future paid services. In others, ideological motives are at play:
students and administrators distribute exam papers freely as acts of
defiance, implicitly declaring that the exams are already meaningless.

This phenomenon illustrates how far perceptions of uselessness have
spread. When answers are shared without cost, it is not merely
malpractice but a symbolic gesture undermining the very legitimacy of
WASSCE and NECO. It suggests that in the minds of many, the exams are
already dead letters---formalities that no longer command respect or
fear.

### Social Acceptance of Malpractice

Underlying all these strategies is a widespread cultural acceptance of
cheating. Students regard malpractice not as moral failure but as a
practical necessity. Parents justify it as an investment in their
children\'s future. Teachers and schools rationalise it as a strategy
for institutional survival. In this cultural climate, malpractice ceases
to be stigmatised; instead, it becomes normalised and routinised.

Surveys by Adebisi (2020) and Ajiboye & Oyewole (2021) found that over
70% of Nigerian secondary school students admitted to engaging in one
form of malpractice or another, while 60% of parents reported being
aware of malpractice and tacitly approving it. Such figures indicate
that malpractice is no longer an exception but the rule.

### Consequences for Literacy and National Development

These strategies have profound consequences. By enabling students to
pass without genuine study, they undermine the development of literacy,
numeracy, and critical thinking. Students graduate with certificates
that bear no relationship to competence. Universities produce
underprepared undergraduates, while employers encounter graduates
incapable of basic workplace tasks.

At a societal level, these strategies perpetuate cycles of incompetence
and corruption. A student who cheats in exams is more likely to cheat in
business, politics, or governance. Thus, cheating in WASSCE and NECO is
not merely an educational issue but a microcosm of Nigeria\'s broader
struggle with integrity and development.

### Summary of Section 4

The strategies of cheating in Nigeria are diverse, ranging from online
leaks sold for as little as ₦500 to WhatsApp and Telegram networks,
supervisor collusion, school complicity, impersonation, and high-tech
devices. These strategies reflect the extent to which malpractice has
become entrenched and commercialised, eroding the credibility of WASSCE
and NECO. The growing practice of free distribution symbolises the
complete devaluation of these exams, reinforcing the perception that
they are meaningless. Ultimately, the sophistication and normalisation
of cheating strategies undermine literacy, weaken educational
institutions, and perpetuate cycles of dishonesty that extend into the
workforce and governance.

## Section 5: Case Study of the 2025 WASSCE English Exam Leak

### Introduction

Among the various manifestations of exam malpractice in Nigeria, the
2025 WASSCE English exam leak stands out as a striking case study.
English Language is one of the most critical subjects in the Nigerian
curriculum, serving as both a compulsory requirement for university
admission and a gateway for professional communication skills. The
leakage of the 2025 English paper, alongside reports of students sitting
for the exam as late as 2 AM, underscores not only the systemic
weaknesses in Nigeria\'s examination administration but also the
cultural normalisation of malpractice. This section examines the details
of the 2025 leak, the responses of stakeholders, and the implications
for educational integrity and literacy.

### The Events of the Leak

Reports from multiple credible news outlets confirmed that the 2025
WASSCE English paper was widely circulated online before the scheduled
exam. Students accessed the questions through Telegram groups, WhatsApp
channels, and specialised websites that claimed to have authentic
\"dubs.\" What made the 2025 case particularly remarkable was the
timing: some candidates were documented writing their exams as late as 2
AM, long after the official examination window had closed, suggesting
deliberate collusion between exam administrators and external actors
(Guardian Nigeria, 2025).

The delay in administering the exam, coupled with the availability of
questions online, created fertile ground for malpractice. Students who
had access to the leaked questions not only prepared answers in advance
but, in some cases, wrote the exam under conditions that allowed them to
consult digital devices or pre-prepared notes.

### Supervisor and School Involvement

Evidence indicated that supervisors and schools were central to the
execution of this malpractice. WAEC\'s subsequent investigation revealed
that several supervisors had been compromised, either by accepting
bribes or by directly facilitating the circulation of papers (WAEC,
2025). Some schools reportedly adjusted exam schedules to allow students
more time with the leaked papers, while others organised \"answer
sessions\" where teachers provided solutions to the leaked questions
before the students sat the exam.

The complicity of schools highlights the extent to which institutional
reputation often outweighs educational integrity. By ensuring that their
students performed well---even through dishonest means---these schools
sought to maintain high pass rates, thereby attracting future
enrolments. This practice illustrates the commercialisation of exam
success as a marketing tool rather than an academic achievement.

### Online Platforms and the Distribution of Leaks

The 2025 case also highlighted the growing role of digital platforms in
exam malpractice. Telegram, in particular, emerged as a hub for
distributing the English exam questions. Channels with thousands of
members openly shared both questions and worked-out answers. Some
platforms monetised access, charging fees as low as ₦500, while others
distributed the materials freely as a way of boosting their credibility.

The free distribution was especially damaging, as it reinforced the
perception among students that WASSCE had become meaningless. By
providing answers at no cost, administrators of these groups essentially
declared that the exams were no longer assessments of skill but
commodities to be circulated like pirated music or movies.

### Reactions from WAEC and the Government

In the aftermath of the leak, WAEC issued strong condemnations, vowing
to identify and punish those responsible. Several supervisors were
reportedly blacklisted, and investigations were launched into complicit
schools (WAEC, 2025). The Nigerian Ministry of Education expressed
concern about the incident, framing it as both a threat to educational
standards and a national embarrassment.

Despite these reactions, public trust remained low. Students and parents
largely dismissed WAEC\'s statements as routine posturing, pointing to
the recurrence of leaks in previous years as evidence that no
substantive change would occur. Many argued that unless systemic reforms
were undertaken---such as stricter digital security and stronger
oversight of supervisors---future leaks would be inevitable.

### Implications for Literacy

The leak of the English exam has particularly dire implications for
literacy. The English Language serves as the medium of instruction
across Nigerian higher education and is vital for participation in the
global economy. When students bypass the process of learning through
malpractice, they fail to acquire the very literacy skills that the exam
is meant to assess.

This failure cascades into higher education, where undergraduates
admitted on the basis of fraudulent English passes struggle to
comprehend academic texts, write essays, or communicate effectively.
Lecturers are then forced to divert energy into remedial teaching,
slowing the pace of university curricula and lowering the overall
standard of education (Ajiboye & Oyewole, 2021).

### The Symbolism of the 2 AM Exams

Perhaps the most telling detail of the 2025 leak was the report of
students writing the exam as late as 2 AM. This extraordinary departure
from official schedules illustrates the depth of systemic rot. It
suggests not only logistical failures but also deliberate collusion to
create conditions favourable for malpractice.

Symbolically, the 2 AM exams represent the erosion of educational
integrity in its starkest form. An exam conducted in the dead of night,
after questions have been leaked online, ceases to be an assessment and
becomes a charade. For students, it confirms the message that rules can
be bent, systems can be manipulated, and genuine preparation is
irrelevant.

### Wider Consequences for Higher Education and the Workforce

The long-term consequences of incidents like the 2025 English leak are
profound. By enabling students to secure credit passes in English
without acquiring functional literacy, Nigeria produces undergraduates
who cannot engage meaningfully with academic material. Universities then
graduate students who lack the skills necessary for professional
communication, critical analysis, and problem-solving.

In the workforce, this translates into employees who cannot draft
professional reports, engage in formal correspondence, or participate in
international markets where English is the lingua franca. Employers
increasingly resort to private aptitude tests or international
certifications to compensate for the unreliability of WASSCE and NECO
results. This dynamic not only erodes the credibility of Nigerian
qualifications but also places the nation at a disadvantage in global
competitiveness.

### Public Perception and the Devaluation of Exams

Public reaction to the 2025 leak reinforced the perception that WASSCE
is useless. On social media, many students mocked the incident, posting
memes and jokes about how easy it was to access questions. Others
expressed cynicism, noting that such leaks were routine and that WAEC\'s
threats of reform were meaningless.

The broader cultural message was clear: WASSCE is no longer a respected
academic hurdle but a compromised ritual. As long as students can secure
passes through malpractice, the exam ceases to function as a measure of
literacy and instead becomes a hollow formality.

### Lessons from the 2025 Case

The 2025 English leak offers several lessons. First, it underscores the
vulnerability of Nigeria\'s examination system to digital leaks,
necessitating a stronger focus on cybersecurity. Second, it highlights
the need for systemic reform of supervisor recruitment and training,
given their frequent complicity in malpractice. Third, it illustrates
the importance of reorienting schools away from reputational concerns
and toward genuine educational outcomes.

Finally, the case demonstrates the urgency of restoring credibility to
Nigerian examinations. Without drastic measures, the cycle of
malpractice will continue, producing undergraduates and graduates who
are ill-prepared for the challenges of higher education and the
workforce.

### Summary of Section 5

The 2025 WASSCE English exam leak epitomises the crisis of educational
integrity in Nigeria. With papers circulating freely online, supervisors
and schools complicit in malpractice, and students writing exams at 2
AM, the episode revealed systemic weaknesses that go beyond isolated
incidents. Its implications for literacy are profound: by undermining
English proficiency, the leak strikes at the heart of Nigeria\'s
educational and economic future. The incident also reinforced the public
perception that WASSCE is meaningless, further entrenching the culture
of malpractice. Unless urgent reforms are undertaken, such leaks will
continue to erode literacy, diminish higher education standards, and
weaken the nation\'s workforce.

### Conclusion

The prevalence of cheating among Nigerian students is both a symptom and
a cause of the deep crisis facing the nation\'s education system. While
recorded figures of literacy and examination success suggest progress,
the reality on the ground reveals that these outcomes are often achieved
through malpractice rather than genuine learning. This has produced a
distorted picture of literacy in Nigeria, where the ability to read and
write meaningfully is far lower than the statistics imply.

The persistent undermining of assessment integrity has rendered
examinations such as WASSCE and NECO SSCE increasingly meaningless in
the eyes of many students, especially when compared with JAMB UTME,
which is perceived to retain more credibility due to its centralised,
computer-based format. The widespread availability of \"dubs\" for as
little as ₦500, and even their free circulation on WhatsApp and
Telegram, reflects a broader societal acceptance of malpractice and the
belief that success in these exams is detached from ability or effort.

Schools themselves often abet malpractice to preserve their reputations,
while corrupt supervisors and insiders within WAEC and NECO contribute
to systemic breaches. The 2025 WASSCE English leak, where students wrote
papers as late as 2 a.m., epitomises the scale of the crisis. It showed
how malpractice has moved from isolated incidents to a culture that
pervades the educational landscape.

The long-term consequences are grave. Universities are filled with
underprepared undergraduates, many of whom lack foundational literacy
and critical thinking skills. These deficiencies translate into a
workforce ill-equipped for national development, further perpetuating
cycles of poverty, unemployment, and underachievement. Nigeria\'s future
competitiveness and stability depend on addressing this crisis.

Restoring integrity requires more than punitive measures. It demands a
cultural shift that values honesty and learning, reinforced by systemic
reforms such as stricter monitoring, secure exam delivery, school
accountability, and technological innovation. Only by addressing the
roots of cheating can Nigeria hope to restore trust in its examinations,
ensure that literacy figures reflect genuine ability, and rebuild an
education system that equips young people for meaningful participation
in society.
